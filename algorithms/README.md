  - Analysis can be more reliable than experimentation. If we experiment, we only know the __behavior__ of a program on certain specific test cases, while analysis can give us __guarantees__ about the performance on all input
  - It helps one choose among different solutions to problems. As we will see, there can be many different solutions to the same problem. A careful analysis and comparison can help us decide which one would be the best for our purpose, without requiring that all be implemented and tested
  - We can predict the performance of a program before we take the time to write code. In a large project, if we waited until after all the code was written to discover that something runs very slowly, it could be a major disaster, but if we do the analysis first we have time to discover speed problems and work around them
  - By analyzing an algorithm, we gain a better understanding of where the fast and slow parts are, and what to work on or work around in order to speed it up
